How many times does the #100 ranked word appear?\n","\n","4. How many times does the #1000 ranked word appear?\n","\n","5. How many times does the #10000 ranked word appear?\n","\n","Do you see a pattern in the results?  We will explore this pattern more in the next notebook."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b8q0Sc5ex4sC","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Solution goes here"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"5-bMqXYVx4sF","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Solution goes here"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Q1eJA-Rkx4sH","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Solution goes here"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Vcpyicybx4sI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Solution goes here"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4r5Zppcbx4sK","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Solution goes here"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bKwknfEqx4sO","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Exercise:** Write a loop that counts how many words appear 200 times.
